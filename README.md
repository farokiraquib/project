# HTML Portfolio 

## 📄 Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built entirely using **HTML5**. 

This was a specific academic assignment. The goal was to master semantic markup, document structure, and the raw functionality of web elements before moving on to styling and interactivity.

**🔴 Live Demo:** [raquibfaroki.netlify.app]

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5** (Semantic Tags, Tables, Forms)

## 📚 Key Concepts Applied
Even without styling, this project demonstrates a strong grasp of:

* **Semantic Structure:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for accessibility.
* **Complex Tables:** Using `colspan`, `rowspan`, and `<thead>`/`<tfoot>` to organize data.
* **Forms & Validation:** Implementing `required`, `pattern`, and different input types (Radio, Checkbox, Select).
